--attempting to rotate a 2d array 
--Maybe i can treat them as matricies multiply by rotation matrix? 

--OKAY SO. This is how code will work, this is what to research and figure out how to do in Haskell.

-- Horse Function:
    -- Basic. Uses ASCII and stores Horse as 2d Array. 
    -- Has Aux function that iterates through array and prints values w/o brakcets and commas

-- Transpose
    -- Utilises Matrix multiplication to rotate array 90ยบ
    -- Function repeated thrice to print in all orientations
    -- ***NEED TO RESEARCH HOW TO DO MATRIX MULT IN HASKELL***
        --Similar to python or math???
